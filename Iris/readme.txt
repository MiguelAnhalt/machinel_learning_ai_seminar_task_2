The Iris Dataset is the “Hello World” equivalent of Machine Learning.

The attributes are numeric so you must figure out how to load and handle data.
It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal).
It only has 4 attributes and 150 instances (rows), meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).
All the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started. 
Balanced class distribution
No missing data.
